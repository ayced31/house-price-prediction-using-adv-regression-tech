# HOUSE-PRICE-PREDICTION-USING-ADVANCED-REGRESSION-TECHNIQUES
This repository contains code and resources for predicting house prices using advanced regression techniques. The project is part of a Kaggle competition that aims to predict the final prices of homes based on various features.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict house prices. The dataset includes various features such as the size of the house, the number of bedrooms, location, and other relevant attributes.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains information on house sales in King County, USA. It includes 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa.
