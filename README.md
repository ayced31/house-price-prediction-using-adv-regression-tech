## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to predict house prices based on a variety of factors, including location, size, number of rooms, neighborhood amenities, and more. This model can be used by real estate professionals, data scientists, and anyone interested in building a predictive model for housing prices.

The project includes:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Advanced feature engineering
- Regression modeling techniques, including linear regression, ridge regression, lasso regression, and XGBoost
- Model evaluation and optimization

## Features and Techniques

The model leverages the following features and techniques:

- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, outlier removal, and data normalization.
- **Feature Engineering**: Generating new features based on existing ones, handling categorical data through encoding, and feature scaling.
- **Advanced Regression Techniques**:
  - **Linear Regression**: Establishing a baseline for prediction.
  - **Regularized Regression (Ridge and Lasso)**: Handling multicollinearity and overfitting.
  - **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)**: Improving predictive performance.
- **Model Evaluation Metrics**: Using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared to measure model accuracy and generalization.

## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Load and preprocess the dataset using the `preprocess_data.py` script.
   ```bash
   python preprocess_data.py
   ```

2. **Train Model**: Train the regression models with `train_model.py`. Specify the model type and hyperparameters as needed.
   ```bash
   python train_model.py --model ridge
   ```

3. **Evaluate Model**: Run the `evaluate_model.py` script to view performance metrics on the test dataset.
   ```bash
   python evaluate_model.py
   ```

## Results

The project achieves an R-squared value of X.XX and a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of X.XX, showing promising predictive performance for estimating house prices. See the `results/` directory for detailed evaluation metrics, comparisons across models, and plots.
